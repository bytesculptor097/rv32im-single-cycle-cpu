# VSDSquadronFM implementation
The [VSDSquadron FPGA Mini](https://www.vlsisystemdesign.com/vsdsquadronfm/) (FM) is a compact and low-cost development board designed for FPGA prototyping and embedded system projects. This board provides a seamless hardware development experience with an integrated programmer, versatile GPIO access, and onboard memory, making it ideal for students, hobbyists, and developers exploring FPGA-based designs.
## Prerequisites

- Linux background or [virtual box](https://www.oracle.com/virtualization/technologies/vm/downloads/virtualbox-downloads.html) OSs that supports Linux (like Ubuntu)
- VSDSquadronFM

## Downloading the necessary building tools

#### Icestorm tools (icepack, icebox, iceprog, icetime, chip databases)
Install them by just running in the linux based terminal:-
```
git clone https://github.com/YosysHQ/icestorm.git icestorm
cd icestorm
make -j$(nproc)
sudo make install
```

#### NextPNR
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/YosysHQ/nextpnr nextpnr
cd nextpnr
cmake -DARCH=ice40 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local .
make -j$(nproc)
sudo make install
```
#### Yosys

```
 git clone https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys.git yosys
 cd yosys
 make -j$(nproc)
 sudo make install
```
### Building the the binaries

Go to the `fpga` folder (Remember to clone this repository) and type in the terminal:-
```
make build
```
*This will generate the binary file like top.bin, top.asc etc.*
### Flashing to the FPGA
Then right after building binaries, type:-
```
sudo make flash
```
*This will flash the binary files to the FPGA*

### Observing the output

After flashing type:-
```
sudo make terminal
```
### OR use an application serial monitor (PuTTY)
1. Go to device  manager (in windows) and click on COM & LPT and observe the COM port for the  FTDI chip.
2. Type the COM number (in my case it is 4)

3. **Type the baud rate 115200**
4. Click on open

*This output because the current loaded instruction is for verifying the M extension of the CPU by calculating MUL, DIV and REM* 

## Observing output in hardware
